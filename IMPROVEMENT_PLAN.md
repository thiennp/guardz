# 🚀 Guardz Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvement plan for the Guardz TypeScript type guard library. The project is already well-structured with excellent test coverage, but there are several areas where we can enhance code quality, security, and developer experience.

## ✅ Current Strengths
- **Excellent Test Coverage**: 807 tests passing with comprehensive coverage
- **Well-Documented**: Extensive README with examples and API documentation
- **Type Safety**: Fully type-safe implementation with proper TypeScript usage
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized code structure with clear separation of concerns
- **Active Development**: Recent updates and good maintenance

## 🎯 Improvement Areas

### 1. Security & Dependencies (High Priority)
**Status**: ⚠️ Needs immediate attention

**Issues Found**:
- 1 low severity vulnerability in `brace-expansion` (used by typedoc)
- Outdated dependencies: Jest (29.7.0 → 30.0.4), @types/jest (29.5.14 → 30.0.0)

**Action Items**:
```bash
# Fix security vulnerability
npm audit fix

# Update dependencies
npm update jest @types/jest typedoc tsc-alias
```

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement (High Priority)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**Improvements Made**:

- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Set up Husky: `npx husky install`

### 4. TypeScript Configuration Enhancement (Medium Priority)
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Improvements Made**:
- ✅ Updated target to ES2020
- ✅ Added stricter type checking options
- ✅ Added source maps and declaration maps
- ✅ Enhanced module resolution
- ✅ Added incremental compilation

### 5. Performance Monitoring (Low Priority)
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Improvements Made**:
- ✅ Added performance benchmarks
- ✅ Set performance thresholds for type guard operations

### 6. Developer Experience (Low Priority)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

**Improvements Made**:
- ✅ Enhanced npm scripts for better workflow
- ✅ Added watch mode for tests
- ✅ Added type checking script
- ✅ Added clean script
